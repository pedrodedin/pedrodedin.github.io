I am a PhD candidate in neutrino physics and astrophysics at the University of Campinas Physics, Brazil. Currently, my research aims to improve our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in supernovae while also exploring the sensitivity to standard and non-standard physics when detecting these neutrinos.
