I am a Ph.D. student in neutrino physics and astrophysics at the University of Campinas Physics Institute. My Ph.D. project is aimed to understand the consequences of neutrino mass hierarchy in the detection of supernova neutrinos. One of the main obstacles is the understanding of flavor conversion in the supernova environment where neutrino-neutrino interactions lead to complicated non-linear evolution equations.
