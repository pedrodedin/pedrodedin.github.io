In core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino-neutrino refraction can lead to flavor conversion{\color{blue} if a \PD{zero-crossing} is present in the neutrino flavor lepton number (FLN) angular distribution. The correspondent flavor instability is }  classified as fast since the neutrino self-interaction strength $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_F n_\nu$ represents the characteristic time-scale of the system. It has been empirically realized that the vacuum frequency $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$ affects the development of {\color{blue} flavor conversion in the presence of \PD{zero-crossing}} even if $\omega \ll \mu$. Focusing on a homogeneous and axially symmetric neutrino gas, we explore the role of $\omega$ in the onset of {\color{blue} flavor instabilities for crossed FLN angular spectra}. We find that a non-zero vacuum frequency is responsible for inducing flavor instabilities with a non-negligible growth rate in a neutrino gas that would be stable for $\omega \rightarrow 0$ despite the presence of a {\color{blue}FLN angular \PD{zero-crossing}}. Relying on a perturbative approach in the vacuum frequency, we find that the odd powers of $\omega$ are linked to the angular distribution of the neutrino flavor particle number (FPN). Hence, when $\omega \neq 0$, the flavor conversion dynamics does not depend on the neutrino FLN only, but also on the FPN. Such a neutrino ensemble with $\omega \neq 0$ can be formally mapped into an effective system with $\omega =0$, whose angular distributions have non-zero imaginary components.
